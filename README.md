# Grammar Correction

This project focuses on building an **Automatic Grammatical Error Correction (GEC)** system for English medical texts.

Involves comparing two approaches:
1. A large out-of-the-box language model (e.g., ChatGPT or Claude) using prompt engineering techniques.
2. A smaller model (e.g., T5-small from Google) fine-tuned.

The specific instructions for the challenge are available in the [Challenge.md](Challenge.md) (in Spanish).
